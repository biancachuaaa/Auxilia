                  Auxilia focuses on mental health. We created this website where people can relax, meditate, appreciate life, show their achievements as little achievements still make a difference in one’s morale and mental health. Making people feel good after accomplishing tasks and collect achievements. We wanted to create a safe space for people if they need to take a breather and just have a safe and calm environment.
